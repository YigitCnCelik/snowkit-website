# MkDocs Project

This repository contains documentation built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator geared towards project documentation. This guide will help you install MkDocs locally and run it in your development environment.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

You can check if Python and pip are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

## Installation

To install MkDocs and set it up locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

   It is good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install MkDocs**

   Use `pip` to install MkDocs and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs
   ```

4. **Install Additional MkDocs Plugins/Themes** (if necessary)

   If your project uses additional plugins or themes, install them with `pip`. For example:

   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs-material
   ```

   Be sure to check the `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of your project for any specific dependencies.

## Running MkDocs Locally

To preview your documentation site locally, run the following command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local development server, and you can view your site by navigating to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Any changes you make to the documentation will be automatically reflected in the browser.

## Project Structure

Your MkDocs project will typically follow this structure:

```
.
├── docs/                   # All markdown files for your documentation
│   ├── index.md            # Home page of your site
│   └── ...
├── mkdocs.yml              # MkDocs configuration file
└── README.md               # Project readme (this file)
```

- **`docs/`**: This directory contains all the markdown files that make up your documentation.
- **`mkdocs.yml`**: This is the main configuration file for your MkDocs site. You can customize the site title, theme, navigation, and other settings here.

## Building the Site

To build a static version of the site that can be hosted on any static site hosting service, use the following command:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will generate a `site/` directory containing all the HTML files and assets for your documentation. You can deploy this folder to any web server or hosting service.
